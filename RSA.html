<h1>RSA finding d</h1>



<p>The original formula will be "ed mod z = 1"</p>
<p>The formula to find d will be "(zn+1)/e = d"</p>
<p>Where n = 1, 2, 3, 4......</p>
<p>Increment n until d is an integer</p>
<br>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>35d mod 264 = 1</p>
<p>The formula to find "d" will be: (264n+1)/35 = d</p>
<p>Where n = 1, 2, 3, 4......</p>
<p>Increment n until d is an integer, which in this case, n is 11 and d is 83</p>
